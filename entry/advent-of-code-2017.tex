\% Justin Le \% December 7, 2017

\emph{Originally posted on
\textbf{\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/advent-of-code-2017.html}{in Code}}.}

Just a short post to share that I started a github repository of my
\href{https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2017}{Advent of Code 2017
Solutions}, as I write them!

I also am including my
\href{https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2017/blob/master/reflections.md}{reflections}
and explanations on my solutions, explaining my thought processes and how the
solutions work.

Yes I definitely spent a bit too much time writing the executable, which is an
automated (cached) downloader, test suite runner (on sample inputs), and
benchmark suite.

I originally was only going to casually try the problems (like I did last year),
but I hit a decent global rank by accident on Day 4 (which was very suited for
Haskell!), and since then I've been taking things seriously to try to aim for
the global leaderboard (top 100). This is a struggle for me because I'm not
really the \emph{fastest} algorithm person, but I think it's a fun goal for me
to try to hit this year.

Wish me luck! And if you haven't started yet, it's not too late to join in the
fun! \href{https://twitter.com/glguy}{glguy} has been maintaining the
semi-official \href{adventofcode.com/2017/leaderboard/private}{Haskell
Leaderboard} (join code \texttt{43100-84040706}) -- come join us!
