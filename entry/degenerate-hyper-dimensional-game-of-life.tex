\title{Breaking a Degenerate Hyper-Dimensional Game of Life}

\begin{document}

\% Justin Le \% February 11, 2021

\emph{Originally posted on
\textbf{\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html}{in
Code}}.}

tldr: Demonstrated with interactive visualizations and simulations --- over the
course of a month, we were able to discover successive new mathematical
properties of a ``degenerate'' hyper-dimensional game of life'' to take a ``7
dimensions may just barely be possible on a commercial PC, could we ever reach
10 dimensions?'' to ``10 dimensions is easy enough to be run on any modern
browser (\hyperref[gol2D]{jump} \hyperref[gol3D]{to} \hyperref[gol4D]{spoilers}
\hyperref[golFlat]{here}), and 60 dimensions can be reached with a compiled
language''.

This is a story about breaking a degenerate hyper-dimensional game of life via
interactive exploratory visualizations and math!

T'was the night before Thursday, December 17, 2020, the release of
\href{https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17}{``Conway Cubes''}. It was Day 17 of
\href{https://adventofcode.com/2020}{Advent of Code 2020}, a series of fun
little themed coding puzzles building up to Christmas; I always enjoyed these
puzzles because they are so self-contained and tidy that they are often
\emph{open-ended} in the interesting ways you can solve them or expand on them
(which I've written
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+advent-of-code.html}{many blog posts
on}).

On the surface, Day 17 seemed to be a straightforward extension of
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway\%27s_Game_of_Life}{Conway's Game Of
Life} (``GoL''). GoL is a simulation played out on a 2D grid, where cells are
``on'' and ``off'', and at each step of the simulation the states spread and
propagate in interesting ways based on the state of their neighbors (a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton}{2D cellular automaton}).
The twist of the Advent of Code puzzle is it asks what would happen if we played
out the rules of GoL in 3D instead, and then 4D.

I submitted my solution on my assigned puzzle input with a naive implementation
(placing 66 and 66 on the leaderboards for that day), concluding the
``competitive'' part. Of course, the real fun always starts after. When
discussing with some friends (on the
\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode}{subreddit} and freenode's
\texttt{\#\#adventofcode} channel), we started talking about the trade-offs of
different implementations and realized that the extra dimensionality was no
joke: as you upped the number of dimensions, the number of points you have to
consider grow exponentially, and so does the number of neighbors at each point
to check. 4D can be solved naively, but anything higher is going to be strained.
My naive solution on 6D took three minutes, and 7D in a reasonable amount of
time (requiring as much as 612,220,032 points with 2,186 neighbors each) seemed
\emph{impossible} on commercial consumer hardware because of the sheer number of
points in 7D space. But I thought\ldots what if a breakthrough in optimization
was possible? I set an (arbitrary) personal goal of reaching 10D
(3,570,467,226,624 points with 59,048 neighbors each), not knowing if it would
ever be possible.

And soon\ldots a breakthrough did come! Someone brought up that if we look at
the 3d version, we see there's actually a \emph{mirror symmetry}! Because
everything starts off on the xy plane, with z=0, the resulting progression must
be symmetrical on both sides (positive and negative z).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{/img/entries/advent-gol/life3d.gif}
\caption{3D GoL animation demonstrating mirror symmetry by
\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfa3nr/2020_day_17_godot_cubes_i_think_i_went_a_bit_too/}{u/ZuBsPaCe}}
\end{figure}

This meant that we only have to simulate the \emph{positive} points (since the
negative points are identical). This saves down the number of points by a factor
of two for each extra dimension! Unfortunately, this wouldn't quite get us to
10D, but the discovery completely changed how we saw this puzzle. With one
breakthrough down, we began to believe that there would be more just around the
corner, made possible by our problem's special 2D-slice starting degeneracy.

Such a dream (as posed in
\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/}{this
reddit thread I started}) turned into a month-long ride of breakthrough after
breakthrough, exploiting different aspects of this degeneracy. It was a month
full of sudden twists and turns and bursts of excitement whenever new
innovations came. And in the end, the hopeful question ``7D is barely in reach;
what if 10D was possible?'' turned into ``10D in 100ms, 40D in eight
minutes\ldots can we do 60D quickly?'' This post even includes simulations to
prove that we got 10D fast enough to run on easily on any modern browser. The
whole journey became an adventure in the power of visualization combined with
abstract thinking.

So, let's take a deep dive --- deeper than you probably ever expected to dive
into any particular degenerate starting conditions of a hyper-dimensional game
of life :D

There will be python code samples here and there, but just for context, my
actual solvers I developed along the way were
\href{https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020/blob/master/src/AOC/Challenge/Day17.hs}{written
in Haskell}, and all of the solving logic embedded in this post was written in
Purescript
(\href{https://github.com/mstksg/inCode/blob/master/app-purescript/Gol.purs}{online
here}) and compiled to Javascript.

Here are some sample fun ones you can try out (click to load):

\item
  The

  which is a ``still-life'' in 2D, but explodes into a twinkling frenzy during

  up until 6D, but then all of a sudden becomes blocky and bland at 7D and
  above.

\end{itemize}

I recommend trying out some of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway\%27s_Game_of_Life\#Examples_of_patterns}{other
interesting well-known patterns} from 2D GoL, as well! If you find any
interesting ones, I would be excited to hear about them!

For fun, here's a 2D vanilla game of life implementation (for six time steps) to
test out your creation. Remember that some starting conditions will putter out
in 2D, but expand forever in 3D+ due to the abundance of neighbors.

Now that that's there, let's start at the beginning: what's the naive, baseline
solution?

A reasonable initial thought would be:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Keep a 2D (or 3D, or 4D, etc.) array of booleans.
\item
  At each step:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Make a fresh copy of the entire space (\(O(n^d)\)).
  \item
    Loop over each item in your array (\(O(n^d)\)). Count all of the neighbors
    (\(O(3^d)\)) that are \texttt{true} (``alive''), and write to the new array
    based on the rules table of GoL (2 or 3 neighbors for a live cell stays
    alive, 3 neighbors for a dead cell turns alive).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  You have a new array! Loop again six times.
\end{enumerate}

Sounds reasonable enough! This does work for the 2D case pretty well (like in
the \href{https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11}{Day 11 puzzle}). However, there
are some clear issues when moving into higher dimensions. The size of your array
grows exponentially on your dimension, and so does the number of neighbors you'd
have to check. And the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality}{curse of
dimensionality} assures us that more and more of that array would become wasted
as the proportion of ``on'' points shrinks to zero for higher dimensions.

Oh, but what's that? The percentage of ``on'' points shrinks to zero for higher
dimensions? That actually sounds like something we can use to our
\emph{advantage}! The \emph{blessing} of dimensionality*, I daresay? Because we
know the vast majority of our points will be ``off'', there's another approach:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Keep a \emph{set} of points that are ``on''.
\item
  At each step:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    Initialize a dynamic map (key-value store, like a python dict or Counter) of
    points to integers. This map associates each point to the number of live
    neighbors it has.
  \item
    For each step, iterate over each of your ``on'' points, expand all of their
    neighbors \(n_i\) (\(O(3^d)\)), and increment the value associated with
    \(n_i\) in your dynamic map.

    For example, if the point \texttt{\textless{}2,3\textgreater{}} is in your
    set of live points, you would add increment the map's values at keys
    \texttt{\textless{}1,2\textgreater{}},
    \texttt{\textless{}2,2\textgreater{}},
    \texttt{\textless{}3,2\textgreater{}}, etc.: all 8 neighbors of
    \texttt{\textless{}2,3\textgreater{}}.
  \item
    Collect your new set of ``on'' points: keep all of the keys in your dynamic
    map corresponding to live points if their integers are 2 or 3, and keep all
    of the keys in your dynamic map corresponding to dead points if their
    integers are 3.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  You have a new set! Loop again six times!
\end{enumerate}

(I discuss this algorithm much more deeply with actual code in
\href{https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020/blob/master/reflections-out/day17.md}{my
solutions write-up in my Advent of Code reflections journal})

This method nets us a huge advantage because we now only have to loop over the
number of items that we know are alive, and any points away from our set of
alive points can be properly ignored. This narrows down our huge iteration
space, and the benefits compound with every dimension due to the blessing of
dimensionality.\footnote{And\ldots there's actually a neat optimization we can
  use (brought to our attention by
  \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/ghmllf8}{Peter
  Tseng}) to avoid the check of the original set in step 2c above: when you
  iterate over each point, increment the eight neighbors' map values by
  \emph{2}, and then increment the point itself by 1. Then in the final integer
  under each key, \texttt{n\ /\ 2} or
  \texttt{n\ \textgreater{}\textgreater{}\ 1} gives you the number of neighbors
  and \texttt{n\ \%\ 2} (modulus) gives you whether or not that cell was alive.}

Both methods can be generalized to any dimension; in this second method, this
just means a different sized tuple/vector in your set of alive points
(\texttt{{[}x,y{]}} vs.~\texttt{{[}x,y,z{]}}). One extra concern, though, is
that you need to think through generating all \(3^d-1\) neighbors: that's going
to come down to a d-ary \href{https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-cross}{cartesian
product} of \texttt{{[}-1,0,1{]}} to itself.

Here's a python implementation of the set-based method, using a nice trick I
learned from \href{https://twitter.com/phaazon_}{phaazon} and
\href{https://github.com/glguy}{glguy} to get the right neighbors by doing a
cartesian product against \texttt{{[}0,-1,1{]}} instead of
\texttt{{[}-1,0,1{]}}, which leaves the first item as the
\texttt{\textless{}0,0\textgreater{}} ``original point'' we want to
exclude.\footnote{There's another optimization too you could use that would
  allow you to ignore this and just treat a cell as its own neighbor; you'd have
  to tweak the live-or-dead rules slightly, but it does simplify a lot of the
  propagation logic.}

\section{Three Dimensions}\label{three-dimensions}

Let's see how this looks for the 3D case! To make things easier to see, we can
render things in ``slices'' in 3D space: each grid represents a slice at a
different z level (ie, the z=0 square represents all squares
\texttt{\textless{}x,y,0\textgreater{}}, the z=1 square represents all squares
\texttt{\textless{}x,y,1\textgreater{}}, etc.). Press ``Play'' to have the
simulation cycle through 6 time steps!

(Some patterns I suggest trying out are the flowery
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=██▟█.▜███.███▙.█▛██}{spiral
galaxy} pattern and patterns with a single reflection symmetry, like the
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=████.▄▗▖▄.▀▝▘▀.████}{broken
bar code}; double symmetry like
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=▛▀▀▜.▌▛▜▐.▌▙▟▐.▙▄▄▟}{bulls-eye}
look nice too!)

In reality, each of those 13 slices above are stacked on top of each other in 3D
space. You'll see that your live cells spread out from the center z=0 slice,
which means they are actually spreading ``up and down'' the z axis.

If you mouse over (or tap) any individual tiny
\texttt{\textless{}x,y\textgreater{}} cell, you'll see the all of the 26
(\(3^d-1\)) \texttt{\textless{}x,y,z\textgreater{}} 3D neighbors of the point
you're hovering over highlighted in blue --- these 26 points form a 3D cube
around your mouse through the stacked slices. You can use this cube to help see
how the simulation progresses. If your mouse is hovering over a live cell, and
there are 2 or 3 live cells highlighted in your cube, it'll stay alive in the
next time step. If your mouse is hovering over a dead cell and there are exactly
3 live cells highlighted in your cube, it will come alive in the next step.

\subsection{Axis Reflection Symmetry}\label{axis-reflection-symmetry}

Try playing around with different initial conditions to see how they evolve! See
any patterns?

Freenode IRC user \href{https://github.com/sim642}{sim642} noticed something
late into the night of December 16th:

\begin{quote}
I wanted to ask this before but forgot: did anyone try to take advantage of the
symmetry, e.g.~in z axis in part 1? Should halve the amount of calculations you
have to do.

Only some extra work at the end to differentiate z=0 and z\textgreater0
positions to know which to count twice And in part 2 I feel like you could also
exploit the symmetry in w axis simultaneously

--- sim642
\end{quote}

You might have seen this too: the entire thing has reflection symmetry across
z=0! z=1 is always the same as z=-1, z=2 is always the same as z=-2, etc.
Fundamentally, this is because our starting solution has a \emph{z-axis
symmetry}: the initial 2D slice is symmetric with reflections across z, because
z=0 for all of those points. This is the first ``degeneracy'' that this blog
post's title is referring to: the negative and positive directions are
interchangeable! This is reflected in the yellow highlight on hover: when you
mouse-over a z square, its corresponding reflected twin is highlighted, and will
always be identical.

This means that we actually only need to simulate \emph{positive} z's\ldots and
for our final answer we just ``un-reflect'' to get the total number.

Let's do this! Apparently, the picture is slightly more complicated than simply
halving the points; we also need to change how to distribute neighbors. That's
because, once we commit to only keeping the positive z's, some cells need to be
double-counted as neighbors. In particular, any \texttt{z=0} cell would
previously had a neighbor at both \texttt{z=-1} and \texttt{z=1}\ldots but now
if we only keep the positive z's, it would have \texttt{z=1} as a neighbor
\emph{twice}.

The following interactive element lets you explore what this looks like:

\phantomsection\label{golSyms3DForward}
\textbf{Element 4a:} 3D Forward Neighbor Multiplicities

\phantomsection\label{golSyms3DForwardCont}

Each square represents an entire ``slice'' of z. When you mouse-over or tap a
z-cell, its z-neighbors are highlighted with how many times that neighbor has to
be counted, and the green bar tells you from what direction that neighborship
arose from. For example, mousing over z=3, you will see z=2 and z=4 get
highlighted with the values ``1'' because they are neighbors of 3, on the left
and right side (respectively). Note that one neat property for all squares
(except for z=6, which goes off the scale) is that the ``total''
higher-dimensional neighbors is always 2 (\(3^{d-2}-1\)) just like before; it's
just that \emph{where} those neighbors fall is re-arranged slightly.

The tricky square is now z=0: if you mouse-over it, you'll see that it has a
single neighbor z=1 that is counted \emph{twice}, as a neighbor from both the
left and right side.

We can compute the above diagram by expanding any z to its neighbors (z-1, and
z+1), applying the absolute value function, and seeing how points double-up.
This gives us the \textbf{forward neighbors}, and we can directly use it for the
original ``keep the full array'' GoL implementation method.

However, for the ``keep active points and expand their neighbors'' GoL
implementation, we have to find the opposite of this. Remember that to build our
``neighbors map'' (the map of points to how many active neighbors they have), we
have each cell ``proactively'' add its contributions to all of its neighbors.
\texttt{\textless{}1,2,3\textgreater{}} is a neighbor to
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,4\textgreater{}} once, so when we expand
\texttt{\textless{}1,2,3\textgreater{}} we would increment the value in the map
at \texttt{\textless{}1,3,4\textgreater{}} by 1 because
\texttt{\textless{}1,2,3\textgreater{}} is a neighbor of
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,4\textgreater{}} once.

So the question becomes: how do we count \texttt{\textless{}1,3,1\textgreater{}}
expanding into \texttt{\textless{}1,3,0\textgreater{}}? Well, normally,
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,1\textgreater{}} is a neighbor of
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,0\textgreater{}} once. However, if we only keep the
normalized z values, \texttt{\textless{}1,3,1\textgreater{}} is a neighbor of
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,0\textgreater{}}\ldots twice! To compute the total
neighbor count of \texttt{\textless{}1,3,0\textgreater{}}, we have to count the
contribution from \texttt{\textless{}1,3,1\textgreater{}} twice (once for
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,1\textgreater{}} and once for
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,-1\textgreater{}}, which also exists, but was normalized
away).

That means we have to follow the original rules, but \emph{backwards}, like:

\phantomsection\label{golSyms3DReverse}
\textbf{Element 4b:} 3D Reverse Neighbor Multiplicities

\phantomsection\label{golSyms3DReverseCont}
Please enable Javascript

These are the \textbf{reverse neighbors}: how many times a given point counts as
a neighbor for its surrounding points. Here, mousing over z=1 shows that it
counts as a neighbor for z=0 twice, from both the left and the right. It also
counts as a neighbor for z=2 once (from the left side).

We can account for this by hard-coding the rules into our step algorithm: if our
z goes from \texttt{1} to \texttt{0}, increment its value twice in the neighbor
map. Otherwise, simply increment by 1 as normal.

This rule is relatively straightforward to implement, and as a result we now
halved our total number of points we need to keep and check for 3D! There's also
a nice way to generalize to arbitrary dimensions: for every
\texttt{1\ -\textgreater{}\ 0} transition in a higher dimension, multiply by
two. That means we reduce the number of 4D points we need to track by a factor
of four, the number of 5D points by a factor of eight, the number of 6D points
by a factor of 16\ldots{} now our total points to check only grows as
\(O(n^d / 2^{d-2})\) instead of \(O(n^d)\)!

Here is a python implementation of this generalization:

This discovery late in the Tuesday night of the 16th was what inspired us to
believe and dream that more breakthroughs might be possible to bring things down
even further.

Those breakthroughs soon came!

\section{Four Dimensions}\label{four-dimensions}

Let's look at how 4D game works! We can visualize this by taking ``z-w'' slices
at different x-y planes. The labels in the following boxes are the
\texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}} of each slice. The very center is
\texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}\ =\ \textless{}0,0\textgreater{}} the row
in the middle from the top is \texttt{w=0}, and the column in the very middle
from the left is \texttt{z=0}. It's basically taking the 3D visualization above
and expanding it in an extra dimension. Press ``Play'' to run your initial
conditions!

\phantomsection\label{gol4D}
\textbf{Element 5:} 4D Game of Life

\phantomsection\label{gol4DCont}

(Some patterns I recommend trying are the patterns with double reflection
symmetry like
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=▛▀▀▜.▌▛▜▐.▌▙▟▐.▙▄▄▟}{bulls-eye},
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=████.████.████.████}{full
block} and the twinkly
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=____._▞▖_._▝__.____}{tub},
rotational symmetry like
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=██▟█.▜███.███▙.█▛██}{spiral
galaxy}, and single-reflection symmetries like
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=████.▄▗▖▄.▀▝▘▀.████}{broken
bar code}, which seems to alternate between different orientations).

Most initial conditions will spread out from the center
\texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}\ =\ \textless{}0,0\textgreater{}} slice
radially, spreading outwards into positive and negative z and w. Mouse-over or
tap any individual tiny \texttt{\textless{}x,y\textgreater{}} cell and you'll
see each of its 80 (\(3^4-1\)) \texttt{\textless{}x,y,z,w\textgreater{}} 4D
neighbors highlighted in blue, forming a little 3x3x3x3
``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Cube}{tesseract}'' (4D cube, or
hypercube). Like in the 3D case, you can use this little hypercube to track how
the simulation progresses: if your mouse if hovering over a live cell with 2 or
3 live cells in its hypercube, it'll stay alive in the next step, if it's
hovering over a dead cell with 3 live cells in its hypercube, it'll come alive
in the next step.

\subsection{Diagonal Reflection Symmetry}\label{diagonal-reflection-symmetry}

Play around and explore how simulations evolve! You will notice that the axis
reflection symmetry is still preserved, as expected, but four ways (the slice at
\texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}\ =\ \textless{}3,4\textgreater{}} is always
going to be identical to the slice at \texttt{\textless{}-3,4\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}3,-4\textgreater{}}, and
\texttt{\textless{}-3,-4\textgreater{}}). These are reflected in the ``deep
yellow'' highlights above when you mouse over a zw square. (Ignore the lighter
yellow highlights for now!)

And now, for the next big breakthrough: this exact visualization was what reddit
user u/cetttbycett was looking at when
\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfjhwh/year_2020_day_17_part_2_using_symmetry_in_4d_space/}{they
made this post} late Thursday the 17th/early Friday the 18th\ldots and
everything changed forever.

\begin{quote}
I noticed that the expansion of active cubes for part 2 is symmetric with
respect to two hyperplanes in 4d space: These hyperplanes can be described by w
= 0 and w-z = 0.

Using these symmetries could make the code nearly eight times as fast.I was
wondering if anyone tried that.

--- u/cetttbycettt
\end{quote}

What u/cetttbycettt saw is what you can see now in the simulation above: it's
all of the \emph{light yellow} highlighted squares when you mouse-over
(highlighting even \emph{more} identical slices to the one you are hovering
over). In addition to the z=0 and w=0 lines (the two lines down the middle,
up-down and left-right), we also have another line of symmetry: z=w and z=-w,
the diagonal lines!

That's right, a zw slice at
\texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}=\textless{}3,4\textgreater{}} is
\emph{identical} to the one at \texttt{\textless{}4,3\textgreater{}}, and so
also \texttt{\textless{}-3,4\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}3,-4\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}-3,-4\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}-4,3\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}4,-3\textgreater{}},
and \texttt{\textless{}-4,-3\textgreater{}}! Each slice is potentially repeated
\emph{eight} times! The exceptions are the points on the lines of symmetry
themselves, which are each repeated only four times, and also
\texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}=\textless{}0,0\textgreater{}}, which is in
a class of its own.

So, our first breakthrough meant that we only have to simulate \emph{positive}
coordinates (a single quadrant)\ldots our next breakthrough means that we only
have to simulate coordinates on a single ``wedge'' half-quadrant\ldots and then
duplicate those eight times at the end. (Arbitrarily, let's say we only simulate
the north-by-northeast wedge, because it's easy to normalize/compact all points
onto that wedge --- you just need to absolute-value all the components and sort
them, and a point like \texttt{\textless{}4,-3\textgreater{}} gets
``normalized'' to \texttt{\textless{}3,4\textgreater{}}))

We found a new symmetry now, but we run into the same issue as before: How do we
propagate neighbors? To help us see what's going on, let's look at the map of
neighbors between different \texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}} squares, for
the single zw wedge we are simulating.

\phantomsection\label{golSyms4DForward}
\textbf{Element 6a:} 4D Forward Neighbor Multiplicities

\phantomsection\label{golSyms4DForwardCont}
Please enable Javascript

These are the \emph{forward neighbors}; we can compute them by expanding a point
to its neighbors, and then normalizing our points and seeing how they double (or
quadruple) up.

For example, mouse over
\texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}=\textless{}3,3\textgreater{}} and see it
has eight total higher-dimensional neighbors (like all points should, though
this visualization leaves out points at w\textgreater6). It's \emph{supposed} to
have a neighbor at \texttt{\textless{}4,3\textgreater{}}, but that gets
reflected back onto \texttt{\textless{}3,4\textgreater{}} during our
normalization process, so you see that the point
\texttt{\textless{}3,3\textgreater{}} has a neighbor at
\texttt{\textless{}3,4\textgreater{}} ``double-counted''. The green squares (in
the north and west positions) at \texttt{\textless{}3,4\textgreater{}} when you
hover over \texttt{\textless{}3,3\textgreater{}} show that
\texttt{\textless{}3,4\textgreater{}} is a neighbor of
\texttt{\textless{}3,3\textgreater{}} both to its north and to its west.

Also, we have something really odd show up for the first time. Mouse over a
point like \texttt{\textless{}z,w\textgreater{}=\textless{}2,3\textgreater{}}
and see that it has a neighbor in\ldots itself? What's going on here? Well, it
is \emph{supposed} to have a neighbor at \texttt{\textless{}3,2\textgreater{}}
but that gets normalized/reflected back onto
\texttt{\textless{}2,3\textgreater{}} --- it reflects onto itself! The green
square in the Southeast means that \texttt{\textless{}2,3\textgreater{}}'s
southeast neighbor is\ldots itself!

Here is a sample python implementation of the computation of forward neighbor
multiplicities for any dimension by propagating-then-normalizing:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ normalize(point):}
    \CommentTok{"""Normalize a point by sorting the absolute values}

\CommentTok{    (2, {-}1)}

\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ forward\_neighbs(point):}
    \CommentTok{"""Generate the higher{-}dimensional forward neighbors of a point}

\CommentTok{    (0, 1)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The forward neighbors are useful for understanding what's going on, but to
actually run our simulation we again need to find the \emph{reverse neighbors}:
from a given point A, how many times is that point a neighbor of another point
B?

We can compute this in brute-force using a cache: iterate over each point,
expand all its neighbors \(a_i\), normalize that neighbor, and then set \(a_i\)
in the cache to the multiplicity after normalization.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ reverse\_neighbs\_table(t\_max):}

                \ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{ neighb }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ weights:}
\NormalTok{                    weights[neighb][(i, j)] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ ncount}
                \ControlFlowTok{else}\NormalTok{:}
\NormalTok{                    weights[neighb] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{(i, j): ncount\}}

    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ weights}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This seems pretty expensive and wasteful, so we'd like to maybe find a formula
to be able to do this using mathematical operations. So, let's explore!

\phantomsection\label{golSyms4DReverse}
\textbf{Element 6b:} 4D Reverse Neighbor Multiplicities

\phantomsection\label{golSyms4DReverseCont}
Please enable Javascript

These are the reverse neighbors, and it follows the same rules for the
\hyperref[golSyms3DReverse]{3D Reverse Neighbors}: mouse over a point and you'll
see how many times it appears as a neighbor to its nearby points. The green
square represents the direction that it sees the hovered point as a neighbor.
It's the flipped version of the \hyperref[golSyms4DForward]{4D Forward
Neighbors} above.

After exploring this interactively, we can maybe think of some rules we can
apply.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If we have a point \texttt{\textless{}z,z\textgreater{}} directly on the z=w
  diagonal, just use its five normal left/up neighbors with weight 1 each.
\item
  If we have a point \texttt{\textless{}z,z+1\textgreater{}} on the ``inner-er''
  diagonal, use its five normal left/up neighbors with weight 1, but its south
  and west neighbors have weight 2, and the point reflects onto \emph{itself}
  with weight 1.
\item
  If we're on \texttt{z=1} and we move into \texttt{z=0}, double that count
  (phew, the same rule as in the 3D case earlier)
\item
  If we're on w=1 and we move into w=0, double that count (same as before)
\item
  And\ldots I guess \texttt{\textless{}0,1\textgreater{}} reflects onto itself
  \emph{twice}? I guess that technically falls under a combination of rule 2 and
  rule 4, but we don't directly observe the motion into w=0 before it gets
  reflected so it has to be special-cased.
\end{enumerate}

Okay, those rules are \emph{sliiightly} more complicated than our 3D rules (``if
we go from z=1 to z=0, double-count it'')\ldots but they're at least mechanical
enough to code in, even if not beautiful. You can probably foresee that it might
be tough to generalize, but\ldots we'll tackle that when we get there :)

For now, we have a super-fast implementation of 4D GoL with our special
degeneracy! The runtime gets reduced by a factor of 8!

For clarity, here's an example implementation of how we can do this
higher-dimensional wrangling:

Now, onward to 5D!

\section{Breaking Through}\label{breaking-through}

By stepping into 5D, we've moved into a brand new territory --- we're now past
what the original question was asking about, and into simply exploring a
personal curiosity for fun. No longer are we ``super-optimizing'' the puzzle ---
we're now warping the original challenge to levels it was never designed to
handle.

It's difficult to visualize how things look in 5 dimensions, so this is where it
gets a little tricky to make any progress, mentally. The first thing we need to
figure out is how exactly we can generalize the ``z=w'' symmetry from 4D to be
able to take advantage of it in 5D\ldots and hopefully in a way that can
generalize to arbitrary dimensions. Along the way we'd also like to get rid of
our hacky 4D neighbor multiplicity rules and get something a little cleaner.

I struggled with for a while without making too much headway\ldots but on the
morning of Friday, December 18th, arguably the biggest revelation of the entire
journey was dropped by Michal Marsalek on u/cetttbycettt's reddit thread. It was
a big deal, because not only did it allow us to generalize our symmetries to
higher dimensions, but it also \emph{proved} a specific degeneracy that allowed
10D simulation to be definitely 100\% \emph{solvable}.

\subsection{Permutation Symmetry}\label{permutation-symmetry}

Here was Michal's
\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfjhwh/year_2020_day_17_part_2_using_symmetry_in_4d_space/gg9vr6m/}{historic
post}:

\begin{quote}
Yes, all the higher dimensions are interchangeable, there's nothing that
distinquishes them. That is, if there's an active cell at position (x,y,
a,b,c,d,e,f,g) then, there's also one at (x,y, c,d,g,e,f,a) and at all other
permutations, of coordinates a-g). That is the number of cells that one need to
track can be reduced by factor of \((d-2)! \times 2^{d-2}\) (at least if time
goes to infinity).

\ldots we can use symmetries coming from permutations, to only track cells where
\(0 \leq x_2 \leq x_3 \leq\,\ldots\, \leq x_{d-1} \leq t\). There's
\(20^2 \times \sum_{k=0}^{t} { {d-3+k} \choose {k} }\) such cells.

--- Michal Marsalek
\end{quote}

\emph{(equations slightly modified)}

And boy was this exciting to read. First of all, it gave a way to generalize the
z=w symmetry: it's just
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation}{permutation symmetry} for all
higher-dimensional coordinates! But the big kicker here: See that last formula?
Let's look at it more closely, using \(\hat{d}\) to represent \(d-2\), the
number of higher dimensions:

\[
20^2 \times \sum_{k=0}^{t} { {\hat{d}-1+k}\choose{k} }
\]

(That notation is the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient}{binomial coefficient},
if you aren't familiar with it.) Note that the summation has a \emph{fixed
number of terms} (with respect to dimension); that means we only ever have 6
terms to expand, no matter how high the dimensions are --- at 10D and even 100D!
Furthermore, we can simplify the above using properties of binomial coefficients
to get

\[
20^2 \times { {\hat{d}+6}\choose{6} }
\]

This binomial coefficient is actually polynomial on \(\hat{d}\) --- it's
\(\frac{1}{6!} \prod_{k=1}^6 (\hat{d}+k)\) --- a sixth degree polynomial
(leading term \(\frac{1}{6!} \hat{d}^6\)), in fact. This means that we have
turned the number of points we potentially need to track from exponential
(\(O(13^{\hat{d}})\)) to slightly smaller exponential (\(O(6^{\hat{d}})\)) to
now \emph{polynomial} (\(O(\hat{d}^6)\))!

So, not only did we figure out a way to generalize/compute our symmetries, we
also now know that this method lets us keep our point set \emph{polynomial} on
the dimension, instead of exponential.

To put a concrete number for context, for that dream of 10D, here are only
\({ {8+6} \choose 6 }\), or 3003 potential unique
\texttt{\textless{}z,w,...\textgreater{}} points, once you factor out
symmetries! The number went down from \(13^8\) (815,730,721) potential unique
\texttt{\textless{}z,w,...\textgreater{}} points to \(6^8\) (1,679,616)
potential unique points with positive/negative symmetry to just 3003 with
permutation symmetry.\footnote{For dramatic effect, I've omitted the fact that
  while there are only 3003 possible higher-dimensional points, there are
  \(20^2 \times 3003\) actual unique points possible factoring in the 20x20 x-y
  grid. Still, it's a pretty big improvement over the original situation
  (\(20^2 \times 815730721\)).} Furthermore, because of the blessing of
dimensionality mentioned earlier, we can expect more and more of those to be
empty as we increase our dimensions.

And in a flash, 10D didn't feel like a dream anymore; it felt like an
inevitability. And now, it was just a race to see who could get there first.

\subsection{The Race to 10D}\label{the-race-to-10d}

Unfortunately, the exact record of who reached and posted 10D first is a bit
lost to history due to reddit's editing records (not that ``first'' is
necessarily a meaningful title to hold; there's no prize, and everyone is
working at their own pace). A few people maintained and updated their posts to
prevent clutter, but the record and time stamp of when they first posted 10D is
lost. If any of them happens to read this and can more accurately verify their
times, I'd be happy to update!

For me, I'm sure I was not the first one, but in my chat logs I see that I
chimed into freenode's \texttt{\#\#adventofcode-spoilers} channel in excitement
in the wee morning hours (PST) Saturday December 19th:

\begin{verbatim}
2020-12-19 02:32:42   jle`    | d=10 in 9m58s
2020-12-19 02:33:05   jle`    | hooray my goal :)

2020-12-19 02:33:35   jle`    | xerox_: thanks :)
\end{verbatim}

Pure joy! :D

\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/ggaaqsy/}{Peter
Tseng} made a post on \emph{Thursday} night with times, but I can't remember if
it incorporated all the symmetries or originally included 10D.
\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/ggsx9e9/}{Michal
Marsalek} was able to implement the idea that he originally proposed by the
following Wednesday (December 23rd) in Nim to blow everyone's time out of the
water: 3 seconds flat!

At that point, it was pretty unbelievable to me that what started out as a dream
goal that we couldn't have reasonably completed on a commercial PC had, through
successive revelations and insights building on each other one by one, could now
be done in 3 seconds.

But hey, I promised 100ms in the introduction, and a way to reach 60D, right?

With our original goal completed, it was now time to dig in a little deeper and
see how far this baby could go.

\subsection{Diving Deeper: Terminology}\label{diving-deeper-terminology}

Before we go any further, let's take a break to clarify and introduce some
terminology we'll be using for the rest of this post.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I've been using the word \textbf{slice} to talk about a 2D grid representing a
  single higher-dimensional \texttt{\textless{}z,w...\textgreater{}} coordinate
  --- they're the 13 grids in \hyperref[gol3D]{the 3D simulation} and the 169
  grids in \hyperref[gol4D]{the 4D simulation}.
\item
  I've also been using \textbf{cell} to refer to an exact specific
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,z,w,..\textgreater{}} spot --- they are the tiny
  squares inside each grid in the simulations above.
\item
  I'll start using the word
  \textbf{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp8sYTlLQRY}{coset}} to refer
  the set of all of the duplicates of an \texttt{\textless{}x,y\textgreater{}}
  across all permutations and negations of
  \texttt{\textless{}z,w,q,..\textgreater{}}, since they all behave the same
  (they are either all on or all off together). So
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,1,2\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,2,1\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,-1,2\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,1,-2\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,-1,-2\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,-2,1\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,2,-1\textgreater{}}, and
  \texttt{\textless{}x,y,-2,-1\textgreater{}} are all a part of the same coset,
  represented by the normalized form \texttt{\textless{}x,y,1,2\textgreater{}}.
  Now, during our simulation, we only need to simulate one member from each
  coset, because every member is identically present or not present. For the
  sake of implementation, we simulate the arbitrary \emph{normalized} (positive
  and sorted) member only. Because of this, we'll sometimes refer to the
  normalized item and the coset it represents as the same thing.
\item
  I'll also start using \textbf{slice coset} to talk about the set of all
  \texttt{\textless{}z,w,...\textgreater{}} slices) across its permutations and
  negations. The slices at z-w coordinates of
  \texttt{\textless{}1,2\textgreater{}}, \texttt{\textless{}2,1\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}-1,2\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}1,-2\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}-1,-2\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}-2,1\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}2,-1\textgreater{}}, and
  \texttt{\textless{}-2,-1\textgreater{}} are all a part of the same slice
  coset, represented by the normalized form
  \texttt{\textless{}1,2\textgreater{}}. All of the slices at each of those zw
  coordinates will always be identical, so we can talk the state of a single
  slice at \texttt{\textless{}1,2\textgreater{}} as representing the state of
  its entire coset.

  Slice cosets are what are being highlighted on mouseovers for the
  \hyperref[gol3D]{3D} and \hyperref[gol4D]{4D simulations}. They are also what
  the big squares represent for the \hyperref[golSyms3DForward]{3D Forward
  Neighbors}, the \hyperref[golSyms3DReverse]{3D Reverse Neighbors}, the
  \hyperref[golSyms4DForward]{4D Reverse Neighbors}, and the
  \hyperref[golSyms4DReverse]{4D Reverse neighbors} elements: each slice stands
  in for their entire slice coset, and we show the amount of times each
  normalized slice coset element is a neighbor of the other.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tackling the Neighbor Problem}\label{tackling-the-neighbor-problem}

My initial d=10 time clocked in at just under 10 minutes initially, but as early
as next Wednesday we knew that a sub-5 second time was possible. So where was
the gap?

Well, I didn't really know what to do about the neighbor multiplicity problem. I
was still brute-forcing by way of forward neighbors + normalizing (as in the
sample 4D python code snippet earlier). The naive brute-force method requires
computing \emph{all} \(3^{ {\hat{d}} } - 1\) higher-dimensional neighbors. So,
even though the number of points I'd have to track grows polynomially, I still
had that pesky exponential factor in building my neighbor cache. At high
dimensions, that exponential factor dominates over everything.

So put on your hard hats and working boots \ldots{} we're going to dive deep
into the world of hyper-dimensional symmetries!

\subsection{Five Dimensions}\label{five-dimensions}

First, let's start visualizing how things look like in 5 dimensions, now that we
know what our slice coset/representative structure looks like. Partially to help
us gain an intuition for some of what's going on, and also partially to show
that intuition at the individual component level can only get so far.

It's a bit difficult to duplicate the same \hyperref[golSyms4DForward]{forward
neighbor}/\hyperref[golSyms4DReverse]{reverse neighbor} interactive elements as
we had for 4D, so here's a different representation. Here is an interactive
element of all of the \texttt{\textless{}z,w,q\textgreater{}} slice cosets (the
wedge of normalized points we track for our implementation) and both their
forward and reverse neighbor weights of each other (computable using the method
we used for 4D). The \texttt{q} axis is represented as stacked zw sections from
left to right.

\phantomsection\label{golSyms5D}
\textbf{Element 7:} 5D Neighbor Multiplicities

\phantomsection\label{golSyms5DCont}
Please enable Javascript

As you mouse-over a slice coset representative (a single square), all of its
neighbors will be highlighted, including reflections. The red dot on the left is
the forward neighbor multiplicity (how many times that other slice is a neighbor
of the hovered slice) and the blue dot on the left is the reverse neighbor
multiplicity (how many times the hovered slice is a neighbor of the other
slice). For example, if you hover over
\texttt{\textless{}z,w,q\textgreater{}=\textless{}1,3,4\textgreater{}}, you can
see that \texttt{\textless{}0,3,4\textgreater{}} is its neighbor twice, and
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,4\textgreater{}} is
\texttt{\textless{}0,3,4\textgreater{}}'s neighbor four times. These four times
come from the normalized reflections of \texttt{\textless{}1,3,4\textgreater{}}
at \texttt{\textless{}1,3,4\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}1,4,3\textgreater{}},
\texttt{\textless{}-1,3,4\textgreater{}}, and
\texttt{\textless{}-1,4,3\textgreater{}}. Some squares are also neighbors to
themselves (like \texttt{\textless{}1,4,5\textgreater{}}, which reflects off of
the top edge at \texttt{\textless{}1,5,4\textgreater{}}) and some are not (like
\texttt{\textless{}1,3,5\textgreater{}}).
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSfebOXSBOE}{Mind bottling}!

At least one pattern we can see clearly is that if you are at a point where each
component is 4 or lower (so it doesn't run off the edge of our table), the sum
of all its neighbors' red dots (the forward neighbors) is \(3^3-1\) = 26, just
like how the sum of forward neighbors for interior points in 3D is \(3^2-1\) =
8, and for 2D is \(3^1-1\) = 2.

Another very important pattern is that ``is a neighbor'' seems to be reversible:
the set of all \emph{forward} neighbors of a point is the same as all
\emph{reverse} neighbors of a point --- the only difference is the
multiplicities. That is, wherever you see a red dot, you will also always see a
blue dot. No single-dot squares.

Anyway, you can explore this a little bit and try to come up with a set of
ad-hoc rules like we did for 4D, but I think we've reached the limits of how far
that method can go. We can generate these values simply enough using the
expand-normalize-tabulate method we did for 4D, but it's pretty inefficient, and
there should be a way to compute these weights \emph{directly} in a clean
fashion that doesn't require hard-coding special cases and patterns. It's clear
that we are limited until we can find this method.

\subsection{Go with the Flow}\label{go-with-the-flow}

What do all our valid normalized \texttt{\textless{}z,w,...\textgreater{}}
coordinates look like? Well, they are always non-decreasing, and always are less
than or equal to the current timestep. Keeping t=6 as our goal still, this means
that valid coordinates in 10D are strings of eight numbers, like
\texttt{0,1,1,1,3,5,5,6}, or \texttt{0,0,3,4,4,4,6,6}, or
\texttt{1,1,2,3,3,4,5,5}.\footnote{It's also interesting to note that above 9D
  (where there are 7 higher-dimensional coordinates), there is always at least
  one duplicated number. Although I don't really know a way to explicitly
  exploit that fact even now, it does mean that there's a qualitative difference
  between 9D and below and 10D and above: anything above 9D is\ldots especially
  degenerate.}

We run into problems working with this format, though. For example, if we're
computing a neighbor of \texttt{0,1,1,1,3,5,5,6}, we can imagine that the very
first \texttt{1} (the w coordinate) could move to be a \texttt{2}, resulting in
\texttt{0,2,1,1,3,5,5,6}. However, we're now in \emph{un-normalized}
territory\ldots we have to re-sort it to turn it into \texttt{0,1,1,2,3,5,5,6}.
This encoding isn't something we can directly manipulate in a nice way.

Because we don't care about order, what if we instead encoded each
higher-dimensional coordinate as ``count of each value seen?'' For example, we
can encode \texttt{0,1,1,1,3,5,5,6} as \texttt{1-3-0-1-0-2-1}: the first slot
represents how many 0s we have, the second how many 1s, the next how many 2s,
the next how many 3s, etc. We can encode \texttt{0,0,3,4,4,4,6,6} as
\texttt{2-0-0-1-3-0-2} and \texttt{1,1,2,3,3,4,5,5} as \texttt{0-2-1-2-1-2-0}.
The \emph{sum} of the components gives you the total number of higher dimensions
(ie, 10D vectors sum to 8)

And now, a ``valid transition'' becomes easy to enforce: it's an amount
``flowing'' from one of those bins to another. For example, turning a \texttt{1}
into a \texttt{2} in \texttt{1-3-0-1-0-2-1} turns it into
\texttt{1-2-1-1-0-2-1}. We took one of the three 1s and turned them into a
single 2. This ``flowing'' operation automatically gives us a valid coordinate
without any re-normalizing necessary!

In this light, we now have an algorithm to compute neighbors without requiring
re-normalization: we can walk bin-to-bin, ``flowing'' components from our origin
vector to our new vector. We no longer have to try all \(3^d-1\) (exponential)
candidates and re-normalize: we can now only iterate through the ones we care
about.

The tricky math is now in computing the multiplicities. Interestingly enough, in
this case, the \emph{reverse} direction is actually easier to conceptualize than
the forward direction. Good for us, because that's the direction we actually
need!

Let's imagine we start at \texttt{0-2-1-3-0} (\texttt{1,1,2,3,3,3}) and ``flow''
to \texttt{0-0-5-0-0} (\texttt{2,2,2,2,2}) by dumping all our bins into 2. How
many ways could this flow happen? The answer happens to be the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem}{multinomial
coefficient} \(5 \choose
{2,1,3}\) (or \(5! / (2!\,1!\,3!)\)): there are 5! ways to end up with 5 in the
bin, but that \texttt{5} came from contributions of \texttt{2+1+3} from either
side, and so we divide by the ways we could pick from those contributing bins
(2!, 1!, and 3!).

Finally, we have to treat multiplicities for transitions from 0 to 1 slightly
differently, because they can arise either a 0 to 1 transition or a 0 to -1
transition. This comes out to a multiplication of \(2^n\) at the end (n being
the amount of 0-to-1 flow). Because of this special care, it's actually more
convenient to fill in bin-by-bin ``backwards'', from the 6 slot to the 5 slot to
the 4 slot, etc., because your options at the 0 component are already
pre-determined for you by the choices you have already made. It keeps the tree a
more manageable shape.

Alright, enough words, let's look at this in action! The following element shows
the \emph{tree} describing all the ways you can flow from bin to bin. As an
example, let's look the 6D case of ways each point is a neighbor of
\texttt{0,2,2,3} (\texttt{1-0-2-1}), which you can pick from the drop-down.

\phantomsection\label{golTree}
\textbf{Element 8:} General Neighbor Multiplicity Algorithm

\phantomsection\label{golTreeCont}
Please enable Javascript

As you can see, each ``branch'' in the tree (reading from left to right) is a
different way to fill in a given bin, from right to left. At each node, the
displayed upper vector is the ``source'' vector, and the lower vector is the
``target'' vector we build bin-by-bin. Bin-by-bin, we begin to move components
from our source vector into our target vector. The branches in the tree reflects
different ways we can commit a bin in our target vector. For example, at the
very first split, we can either pick our final vector to be \texttt{?-?-?-?-0}
(leaving that 3 bin alone) or \texttt{?-?-?-?-1} (swiping a component from that
3 bin in the source vector). The operation shown to the right of the node
represents how we modify our weights according to the choices we make according
to the logic above. The nodes on the far right also show the end products: the
actual neighbors, along with their multiplicities.

If you mouse-over or tap a node, it'll highlight the trace from the beginning to
the node you are highlighting, so you can see all of the choices made, as well
as all the operations applied to our running multiplicity counter at each step.
It'll also show the contributions from the left, center, and right of the
current bin being picked (the \(2+1+3\) in the example above), and also the
``regular'' vector representation. For example,
\texttt{\textless{}{[}2,2{]},2,4\textgreater{}} means that that node has already
committed to having \texttt{\textless{}?,?,2,4\textgreater{}} in the target
vector, but still has two 2s in the source vector to pull in and distribute.

One final thing we need to keep track of is to not count a point transitioning
to itself if it results from no actual internal changes (this is the ``minus
one'' in \(3^d-1\): we should not include the single original point itself, but
we \emph{should} count extra occurrences of the original point if it arose from
a reflection). This can be done by checking if each of our bin choices involved
exactly no inter-bin flows (they were all of the form \texttt{0+x+0}).

Phew! That's a bit of a mathematical doozy, huh? But trust me when I say it's
easier to understand if play around with the interactive element and follow
along the traces. After a few examples in different dimensions, it might start
to make sense. Try looking at the lower dimensions too to see if they match up
with what we figured out before.

You can also flip the switch on the element to compute reverse and forward
neighbors. Luckily, as we noted before, if a point is a forward neighbor, it is
also a reverse neighbor. This means that the branching structure for forward and
reverse neighbor trees are exactly the same; the only difference is how the
multiplicities are calculated. In this case, the forward direction is just the
original calculation ``reversed''! The diagram shows how the multiplicities are
accumulated; feel free to try to work out exactly how this works as a fun
exercise :)

And with that, we have tackled the reverse neighbor weights problem with some
branching bin flows and combinatorics!

\section{Stacks On Stacks: Visualizing Arbitrary
Dimensions}\label{stacks-on-stacks-visualizing-arbitrary-dimensions}

You might have noticed that ever since our 4D simulation, we haven't had a new
visualization of simulation, despite now having higher dimensions in our grasp.
Why not?

Well, there's the question of \emph{how} you might even visualize this. You can
``zoom out'' and take higher-dimensional slices of our 4D visualization and
repeat this ad nauseam, but that doesn't really add anything or give any insight
as to what's really going on.

I believe that this is one of the things that caused us to all collectively get
``stuck'' together around 20 dimensions. The rush of the revelations one after
within a single week pushed us into trying many different things. I had a couple
of dead-end forays into pre-cacheing and had a lot of code (that I was ecstatic
to be able to later delete) working with an sqlite3 database.\footnote{One
  useful lasting thing I did find (that I won't spend too much time on here) was
  a way to
  \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/gim68l0/}{index
  into an enumeration} of all of the slice cosets (that is, all the normalized
  higher-dimensional coordinates). I no longer store
  \texttt{\textless{}z,w,...\textgreater{}} points as vectors, but rather as a
  single integer representing their index in that enumeration, which is easier
  to access and store. I also found a way to do streaming decoding and encoding
  between that index and the components it represents, allowing me to stream
  neighbor weights in constant time. This dense index encoding was actually
  really useful in implementing the Javascript demos on this page :)}

Another factor that probably contributed to the overall lull was that Advent of
Code was still running, and we all still enjoyed doing the new puzzles every
day. But soon, Christmas passed, the daily rush of doing new puzzles faded, and
we started to return back to tinkering on this hyper-dimensional game of life
puzzle. It wouldn't be until January 1st, 2021 (just over two weeks after the
puzzle originally came out) that a new revelation arose that would pave the way
shoot far past 20D.

It was
\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/ghre3ce/}{Michal
Marsalek's coset counts post} that set the stage. From the beginning, he had
always tracked the number of cell cosets at the end of the simulation (the
number of active ``normalized'' cells), and had been exploring the relationship
between dimension and coset counts. The discovery was that after a certain
``saturation point'' (6D for Michal's set, 9D for Peter's set, 7D for my set),
all of the coset counts were \emph{perfectly quadratic}! For mine, it followed
the relationship \(d^2 + 109d + 70\) exactly for 7D and higher.

My best guess as to why this was happening is that, at 7D and above, we enter a
domain of points where, before t=6, \emph{every} point is at some sort of
reflective boundary. Remember that even for 4D, we had really odd behavior at
the reflective boundaries/edge of the wedge. There wasn't enough room for many
points to ``stretch their wings'' --- every single one is at one reflective
boundary or another. Being a boundary point corresponds to having a ``bins''
encoding with any bin greater than one or anything in the 0 bin (ie,
\texttt{1-0-0-0} and \texttt{0-2-0} are all points on a reflective boundary).

Unfortunately, having a closed-form way to compute coset counts doesn't actually
give us a way to compute the final state itself (that we know of, yet), since it
doesn't tell us \emph{which} cosets are active, just how many. However, this
prompted me to investigate a little bit more about what was causing this pattern
and how these cosets were distributed. To do this, I tried a new way to
visualize things.

In our simulation, x and y components are fundamentally different from the
others; we could actually talk about each point as a tuple
\texttt{(\textless{}x,y\textgreater{},\ \{higher\ dims\})}. Also, points are
usually \emph{dense} in \texttt{\textless{}x,y\textgreater{}} (a significant
fraction of the xy space has at least one point), but \emph{sparse} in higher
dimensions (a very small fraction of the higher-dimensional space actually has a
point in it). Instead of keeping our active points as a set of cosets, we could
treat it as a map of \texttt{\textless{}x,y\textgreater{}} points to the
higher-dimension slice cosets that live ``under them''. That is, instead of
keeping one giant set as:

\begin{verbatim}
{<1,2,1,1,3>, <3,1,1,1,4>, <1,2,0,0,5>, <4,2,3,4,4>, <3,1,2,2,2>}
\end{verbatim}

we could instead keep a map of sets:

\begin{verbatim}
<1,2>: { <1,1,3>, <0,0,5> }
<3,1>: { <1,1,4>, <2,2,2> }
<4,2>: { <3,3,4> }
\end{verbatim}

and propagate \emph{that} in our simulation. I like to call those sets under
each 2d point (ie, the
\texttt{\{\textless{}1,1,3\textgreater{},\ \textless{}0,0,5\textgreater{}\}}) a
``coset stack''.

I did this initially to investigate the nature of the cosets that were showing
up, but once I plotted it and animated things, I realized that in doing this, we
are reducing the entire hyper-dimensional problem \emph{back to a variant of 2D
cellular automaton}! This whole thing becomes reframed\ldots instead of a
mind-bending hyper-dimensional deal, it's now simply \emph{multivalued 2D
cellular automaton} with funky rules! It's like a normal 2D game of life, but
with funky rules for 2D points spreading to each other.

Here is the final animation: we plot a single 2D grid, and each cell is colored
according to the size of the coset stack under that point (how many points exist
with that \texttt{\textless{}x,y\textgreater{}}). You can slide this one up all
the way to 10D to simulate it in your browser!

(A lot of examples with symmetries look nice here, such as
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=██▟█.▜███.███▙.█▛██}{spiral
galaxy} up to 6D and
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=▛▀▀▜.▌▛▜▐.▌▙▟▐.▙▄▄▟}{bulls-eye};
the alternating symmetries of
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=████.▄▗▖▄.▀▝▘▀.████}{broken
bar code} look nice too! But honestly, at higher-dimensions, almost any input
ends up generating appealing gradients, like
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=____._▝▖_._▀▘_.____}{glider}
and
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=▛▜▙▐.▜▚▗_.█▟▄▘.▟▌▟█}{my
own assigned input})

Play around with it, it's the big finale! :D You can move all the way up to 10D;
some older devices may struggle, but on my lower-end cell phone it seems to run
in less than a second. If you mouse-over a cell, the text box will show all of
the slice cosets where that xy cell is alive in (the ``coset stack''). If you
click on a cell, your selection will ``lock'' on that
\texttt{\textless{}x,y\textgreater{}} coordinate as you change dimensions and
time.

Some interesting things you might notice:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  At t=6, it looks like 8D, 9D, 10D (and sometimes 6D,7D) all have the
  \emph{same} exact 2D cells ``on''. They're identical except for slightly
  different stacks above each of those cells.

  To see this clearly, set your time to t=6 and drag your dimension slider back
  and forth to see all of the higher-dimensions look identical in shape.

  This probably has something to do with the saturation theory I mentioned
  earlier, and is also why
  \href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=██▟█.▜███.███▙.█▛██}{spiral
  galaxy} \emph{suddenly} turns from rich and beautiful at 6D to blocky and ugly
  at 7D.
\item
  At t=2, t=4, past 5D or so, the state is exactly the same for all dimensions
  for any initial condition I have tried! We could easily find t=4 for 100D or
  even 200D: they're identical!
\item
  A lot of xy cells share identical coset stacks\ldots more on that later!
\end{enumerate}

Not only is it kinda pretty (in my humble opinion), it also demonstrates that
this whole ordeal is really ``just a multivalued 2D cellular automaton'': it's
like a ``multi-valued'' Game of Life, where instead of cells being on and off,
they are one of several discrete choices of values. Instead of a ``binary'' game
of life with a boolean at each cell, it's an ``integer'' game of life with a
finite choice at each cell.

Because there are \({ {\hat{d}}+t} \choose t\) slice cosets for a given
dimension and time, it means that our game is a
\(2^{ { \hat{d} + t} \choose t }\)-valued game of life, where each cell can be
one of that many options (each slice coset and be present or not). That means at
2D (\(\hat{d} = 0\)), we have a normal 2-valued game of life (\(2^1\)), at 3D we
have \(7 \choose 6\) or 7 possible points at t=6, so that's a \(2^7\) or
128-valued game of life, at 4D we have \(8
\choose 6\) or 28 possible points at t=6, and so that's a \(2^{28}\) or
268,435,456-valued game of life.

You can see this demonstrated in the simulation above, as well. As you progress,
each 2D cell ``spreads'' to its neighbors according to some complex rule; it's
like watching 2d cells interact with each other in complex ways, without ever
even having to think of higher dimensions.

Implementing things this way (and taking advantage of the fact that coset stacks
are usually very sparse and have few members) gave a nice conceptual shake-up.
But there's one final thing that this view would unlock that would make the
biggest difference.

\subsection{Repeated Stacks}\label{repeated-stacks}

You might have noticed in the final 10D simulation, if you mouse over an xy
cell, it'll also highlight over all of the other xy cells that hold the same
coset stack. For most initial starting positions, you might notice something
maybe even more curious --- a \emph{lot} of those stacks are duplicated over
many xy cells.

In my
\href{https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html?points=▛▜▙▐.▜▚▗_.█▟▄▘.▟▌▟█}{personal
puzzle input} (click to load into the simulation), \emph{most} of the stacks
were duplicated many times across different xy cells. If you highlight the cells
in any arbitrary starting condition through t=6, you'll see too that many (if
not most) xy cells have multiple other xy cells that have identical stacks to
them.

This final insight yields the final optimization we have discovered, as of time
of writing. We can actually treat an \emph{entire stack} as an ``action'' that
is spread to the xy neighbors: The stack under
\texttt{\textless{}x,y\textgreater{}=\textless{}3,4\textgreater{}} is spread to
all its eight 2D neighbors identically (and to itself, too, in a way that
excludes the original stack itself). That means if you have a stack, you can
compute the contribution to a neighbor (expensive) it has \emph{one time}, and
then \emph{repeat that same contribution} to every occurrence of a stack. So if
a stack is repeated ten times over ten different xy stacks, you only need to
compute it once and propagate it to all 9x10 neighbors of those stacks (nine
neighbors, including self, times each of the 10 repetitions), for a savings of
x90! This can be done by storing map of stacks to contributions as a cache.

With this final piece of the puzzle, I was able to reach 18D \emph{3 seconds} in
my Haskell solution, and 30D in 5 minutes! Michal Marsalek was also able to
build this into their fast Nim solver to
\href{https://www.reddit.com/user/MichalMarsalek/}{reach 40D in 8 minutes, 50D
in 32 minutes, 60D in 120 minutes}.

And as far as I know, this seems to be where things stand today (Feburary 2021).

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Hope you enjoyed this journey! My hope is that I was able to convey a fraction
of the excitement, wonder, and mystery I felt during the process. At every
point, we had no reason to believe something better would come around the
corner, but we held on to a hope and faith that kept on rewarding us.

Visualization and different perspectives seem to drive almost every revelation
--- from the visually striking symmetries of the 3D and 4D simulations, the
explorations of how neighbor relationships work, the insight that we could treat
the entire problem as a fancy multivalued 2D game of life\ldots all of it came
about from being able to see the problem visually in different ways. At other
times it was a simple change in perspective to find a better way of encoding
variants or looking at how a specific number changed. I know for myself, the
next time I try to explore something like this, I will try to apply what I
learned to always reach for visualization sooner. Even dead-end visualizations
can sometimes provide a new depth to the puzzle that you might appreciate later
on.

Another thing I hope was apparent was the power of community! I know I
definitely would not have had as much fun doing this if it wasn't for the
vibrant Advent of Code ``Ante-Pushing'' community. What I've described is just
\emph{one story} (Day 17, 2020) out of so many that Advent of Code community
members routinely explore together (through 25 puzzles each year for five
years). Most of these discoveries were fun because we always had somebody to
share them with, or a way to encourage each other and strive for a common goal.
I'm definitely lucky to be standing on giants as a part of a talented and
passionately curious community that's excited to explore things like this.

Thank you to so many people --- Michal Marsalek, Peter Tseng, leftylink, sim642,
ephemient, yitz, cyphase, phaazon, glguy, /u/cetttbycettt, /u/bsterc, /u/flwyd,
and so many others that I probably missed. An especially deep thanks to
\href{https://twitter.com/ericwastl}{Eric Wastl} for hosting a wonderful event
like Advent of Code every year. Finally, a profoundly deep thanks to the late
John Conway, who revealed to us how much joy can come from the exploration of
all things mathematical, a genius who was taken away from this world much too
soon.

And of course, in making this post, I'm inviting you, the reader, to join us
along in this journey as well! It's hardly over :) Now that you're up to speed
with all of us, I'd be excited to hear about anything you might discover while
playing around with this too!

Looking forward at least, there are a some open threads still.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Notice on the \hyperref[gol4D]{4D simulation}, very soon after simulations
  start, the two diagonals become very empty, and especially the 3x3 region at
  the origin where they intersect. It turns out that reflection symmetry
  boundaries are very inhospitable because they have \emph{so many neighbors}
  after reflection, especially at higher dimensions (see the top-right slice at
  each q level in \hyperref[golSyms5D]{the 5D symmetries}). Could these ``dead
  zones'' be extended and exploited at higher dimensions?
\item
  The most promising to me: for t=6, the exact same xy cells are always
  inhabited for any dimension past 7D or so, and the stacks at each seem to only
  change slightly from dimension to dimension. If we can analytically find how
  the stacks at any given position change between 9D and 10D, 10D and 11D, etc.,
  then it will be easy to jump directly to t=6 at 100D without simulating
  anything. Another way to say this is --- can we simulate by fixing t and
  stepping d, instead of fixing d and stepping t?
\end{enumerate}

Who can tell how far we can go?
\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/gia880d/}{Michal}
has a personal goal that I would also be very happy to reach:

\begin{quote}
I won't be satisfied until I implement a solution that runs in polynomial time
in both t and d.

--- Michal Marsalek
\end{quote}

Will you, dear reader, be the one to take us there? :)
